### ~ Harmonic series ~

It is said that non of the sounds we hear in everyday life is consisted of a single sine wave. Instead they are a sum of sine waves at different frequencies and amplitudes.

Also, it is said that any waveform can be represented as a set of sine waves.

If so, how could we create a saw wave or square wave, which we often see in synthesizers, from multiple of sine waves?

#### Sawtooth Wave

A sawtooth wave contains both even and odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. This means that if we set the fundamental frequency to be 440Hz, the sawtooth wave would contain 440Hz (1 x 440), 880Hz (2 x 440), 1320Hz (3 x 440), 1760Hz (4 x 440), 2200Hz (5 x 440), and so on.

The mathematical representation would be:

\\[ y\_{sawtooth} (t) = \mathop{\sum_{k=1}^\infty} \frac{sin(2 \pi kft)}{k} \\]

One thing to note here is that the amplitude of each harmonic is divided by its harmonic ratio. So, in the case of 440Hz, the added 880Hz harmonic would have half amplitude of 440Hz, and 1320Hz would have one third.

The visual representation of a sawtooth wave (1Hz) would look like below (with first 9 harmonics):

<wave-plot :frequency="1" :length="1" :sines="[{ level: 0.58, ratio: 1 }, { level: 0.29, ratio: 2 }, { level: 0.193, ratio: 3 }, { level: 0.145, ratio: 4 }, { level: 0.116, ratio: 5 }, { level: 0.0967, ratio: 6 }, { level: 0.0829, ratio: 7 }, { level: 0.0725, ratio: 8 }, { level: 0.0644, ratio: 9 }]"></wave-plot>

In javascript, it would look like this:

```js
const sampleRate = 44100 // how many samples per second. usually 44100 or 48000
const sampleLength = 1 // second
const frequency = 1 // Hz
const output = []

for (let i = 0; i < sampleRate * sampleLength; i++) {
  output[i] = 0
  for (let k = 1; k <= 9; k++) {
    output[i] += Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * k * frequency * i) / sampleRate) / k
  }
}
```

#### Square Wave

\\[ y\_{square} (t) = \mathop{\sum_{k=1}^\infty} \frac{sin(2 \pi (2k - 1)ft)}{2k - 1} \\]

<wave-plot :frequency="1" :length="1" :sines="[{ level: 0.58, ratio: 1 }, { level: 0.193, ratio: 3 }, { level: 0.116, ratio: 5 }, { level: 0.0829, ratio: 7 }, { level: 0.0644, ratio: 9 }]"></wave-plot>

In javascript, it would look like this:

```js
const sampleRate = 44100 // how many samples per second. usually 44100 or 48000
const sampleLength = 1 // second
const frequency = 1 // Hz
const output = []

for (let i = 0; i < sampleRate * sampleLength; i++) {
  output[i] = 0
  for (let k = 1; k <= 9; k += 2) {
    output[i] += Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * k * frequency * i) / sampleRate) / k
  }
}
```
