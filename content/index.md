## Introduction

As an enthusiastic user of hardware samplers and ableton live, I wanted to create audio samples with learning basics of waveforms and a new programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The audio files used in this site were generated with a simple cli I wrote in Rust (if you're interested in the code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/yyyk/wave-generator)).
