### ~ Sine wave ~

According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave), a sine wave is

> ...a mathematical curve that describes a smooth periodic oscillation. A sine wave is a continuous wave. It is named after the function sine, of which it is the graph. It occurs often in pure and applied mathematics, as well as physics, engineering, signal processing and many other fields. Its most basic form as a function of time (t) is:

> \\( y(t) = A sin(2 \pi ft + \phi) = A sin( \omega t + \phi) \\)

> where:

> - \\(A\\), amplitude, the peak deviation of the function from zero.

> - \\(f\\), ordinary frequency, the number of oscillations (cycles) that occur each second of time.

> - \\(\omega = 2 \pi f\\), angular frequency, the rate of change of the function argument in units of radians per second

> - \\(\phi\\), phase, specifies (in radians) where in its cycle the oscillation is at \\(t = 0\\).

If I draw a sine wave which has an amplitude of 1.0 and frequency of 1Hz with no phase, it would look like:

<wave-plot :frequency="1" :length="1" :sines="[{ level: 1, ratio: 1 }]"></wave-plot>

It has one cycle over a second, and can be expressed as \\( y(t) = sin(2 \pi t) \\).

In javascript, it would look like this:

```js
const sampleRate = 44100 // how many samples per second. usually 44100 or 48000
const sampleLength = 1 // second
const output = []

for (let i = 0; i < sampleRate * sampleLength; i++) {
  output[i] = Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * i) / sampleRate)
}
```

With the frequency of 440Hz (meaning 440 cycles over a second), it would look like:

<wave-plot :frequency="440" :length="1" :sines="[{ level: 1, ratio: 1 }]"></wave-plot>

and sound like:

<audio controls controlsList="nodownload">
  <source src="/audio/sine-440-1s.wav" type="audio/wav">
</audio>

In javascript:

```js
const sampleRate = 44100 // how many samples per second. usually 44100 or 48000
const sampleLength = 1 // second
const frequency = 440 // Hz
const output = []

for (let i = 0; i < sampleRate * sampleLength; i++) {
  output[i] = Math.sin((2 * Math.PI * frequency * i) / sampleRate)
}
```

This is where I started.
